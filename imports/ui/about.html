        <p>
        It's hard to keep track of everything that you eat,
        but it's not just that.
        </p>

        <p>
        When your stomach feels weird after a meal, you're never quite
        sure whether it was the sriracha that you put on your breakfast
        omelette, or that extra spicy Thai food you had for dinner.
        </p>

        <p>
        Poopmo helps you keep track of food that might make
        your gut unhappy so that we can help you identify things
        you can avoid... and things you can eat more of :)
        </p>

        Get your gut feeling good!
